This repository follows a microservices-oriented architecture deployed on Kubernetes. The cluster runs multiple Deployments and a Promtail DaemonSet across worker nodes, with an Ingress Controller routing external HTTP traffic to frontend/backends. Each major service (helpsite, spring-backend, cpp-stock-ui-sidecar, python-watchlist-gui, dashboard-service, log-collector) is packaged as a Deployment and exposed via a Service; service accounts and ConfigMaps/Secrets provide per-service credentials and configuration.

Observability is implemented with Prometheus (metrics), Grafana (dashboards), Loki (log store), and Promtail (DaemonSet for log shipping). A custom `log-collector` ingests application logs and exposes metrics for scraping by Prometheus. Data storage is lightweight and local in this workspace (SQLite used by the Spring app); no external message queue or managed DB was detected. Technology stacks: Django (Python) for the helpsite, Spring Boot (Java) for backend services, C++ for the `cpp-stock-ui` with a log-sidecar, Python/Flask for `log-collector` and `dashboard-service`, and standard observability tools (Prometheus/Grafana/Loki/Promtail). Network policies and service accounts are used conceptually to enforce access control between services.
